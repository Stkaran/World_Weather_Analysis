# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

This project focused on gathering data using OpenWeatherMap's API service in order to plan a vaction based off of a user's weather preference. Then we took this data and used pandas to put the data we wanted to into dataframes for easier use. Lastly, after selecting the cites we wanted to visit, we used gmaps to plan a route to visit a all of our selected cities.
